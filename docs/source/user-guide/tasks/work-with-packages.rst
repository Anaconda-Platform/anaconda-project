=====================
Working with packages
=====================

The ``anaconda-project.yml`` file enables specification
of required packages and multiple Conda environments, referred
to as ``env_specs``.

For example the following ``anaconda-project.yml`` file will
install ``python`` version 3.8, and latest version ``pandas``
and ``notebook`` into the default environment when you execute
``anaconda-project prepare`` on the command line.

.. code-block:: yaml

  name: ExampleProject

  packages:
    - python=3.8
    - notebook
    - pandas
  
  env_specs:
    default: {}

When ``anaconda-project prepare`` is run a new environment is created
called ``default`` in the ``envs`` subdirectory of your project.
See :ref:`Configuration` to change the default location of the Conda environments.

***************
Adding packages
***************

To add packages to your project that are not yet in your
``packages:`` list there are two appraoches.

#. From within your project directory, run::

     anaconda-project add-packages package1 package2

   NOTE: Replace ``package1`` and ``package2`` with the names of
   the packages that you want to include. You can specify as many
   packages as you want.

   EXAMPLE: To add the packages hvplot=0.7 and dask::

     $ anaconda-project add-packages hvplot=0.7 dask
     Collecting package metadata (current_repodata.json): ...working... done
     Solving environment: ...working... done
     ...
     Executing transaction: ...working... done
     Using Conda environment /Users/adefusco/Desktop/iris/envs/default.
     Added packages to project file: hvplot=0.7, dask.

#. Instead of using the ``add-packages`` command you can edit the ``anaconda-project.yml``
   file directly using any text editor and add package names to the ``packages:`` list.
   To complete the installation of these new packages into your activate environment run
   ``anaconda-project prepare`` on the command line after saving the file.

In addition to adding Conda packages as shown above Pip packages
can be specified using the ``--pip`` flag::

  anaconda-project add-packages --pip package1 package2

NOTE: Replace ``package1`` and ``package2`` with the names of
the packages that you want to include. You can specify as many
packages as you want.

EXAMPLE: To add the ``requests`` package to the default environment::

  $ anaconda-project add-packages --pip requests
  Collecting requests
    Using cached requests-2.25.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl (61 kB)
  Requirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in ./envs/default/lib/python3.8/site-packages (from requests) (2020.12.5)
  Collecting idna<3,>=2.5
    Using cached idna-2.10-py2.py3-none-any.whl (58 kB)
  Collecting chardet<5,>=3.0.2
    Using cached chardet-4.0.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl (178 kB)
  Collecting urllib3<1.27,>=1.21.1
    Using cached urllib3-1.26.4-py2.py3-none-any.whl (153 kB)
  Installing collected packages: urllib3, idna, chardet, requests
  Successfully installed chardet-4.0.0 idna-2.10 requests-2.25.1 urllib3-1.26.4
  Using Conda environment /Users/adefusco/Desktop/testproj/envs/default.
  Added packages to project file: requests.

Optionally, you can edit the ``anaconda-project.yml`` file to add packages using
the ``pip:`` key within the ``packages:`` list. For example,

.. code-block:: yaml

  name: ExampleProject

  packages:
    - python=3.8
    - notebook
    - pandas
    - pip:
      - requests
  
  env_specs:
    default: {}

Then run ``anaconda-project prepare`` to install the new packages into the environment.

*****************
Removing packages
*****************

To remove packages from the ``packages:`` list run::

  anaconda-project remove-packages package1 package2

NOTE: Replace ``package1`` and ``package2`` with the names of
the packages that you want to include. You can specify as many
packages as you want.

EXAMPLE: To remove the package hvplot::

  $ anaconda-project remove-packages hvplot
  Using Conda environment /Users/adefusco/Desktop/testproj/envs/default.
  Removed packages from project file: hvplot.

EXAMPLE: To remove the ``requests`` pip package from the default environment::

  $ anaconda-project remove-packages --pip requests
  Found existing installation: requests 2.25.1
  Uninstalling requests-2.25.1:
    Successfully uninstalled requests-2.25.1
  Using Conda environment /Users/adefusco/Desktop/testproj/envs/default.
  Removed packages from project file: requests.


Pip package specifications
==========================

Pip packages can specified in a number of ways.

* From PyPI (or other indexes)
* Direct URL to the package archive
* Revision Control services (for example git and svn)

To install a package from a revision control service::

  anaconda-project add-packages --pip git+<protocol>://<revision-control-domain>/<repository.git>[version-branch]#egg=<package-name>

Where

* ``<protocol>`` is the web protocol of the domain: i.e, ``http`` or ``https``
* ``<revision-control-domain>`` is the URL of the service: i.e. ``github.com``
* ``<repository.git>`` is the name of the revision control repository, you can include the branch name or release tag here.
* ``[version-branch]`` optionally install a specific version or branch of the repository
* ``<package>`` is the name of the package as declared in ``setup.py``

NOTE: It is required that you use ``#egg=<package>`` to install a revision control hosted
package. This is considered `best practice by pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/cli/pip_install/#vcs-support>`_ and allows the pip dependency solver to 
correctly identify the package if it is a dependency of another package in your project.

EXAMPLE: Add the tranquilizer package to your project directly from Github::

  $ anaconda-project add-packages --pip git+https://github.com/continuumio/tranquilizer.git@0.5.0#egg=tranquilizer
  Collecting tranquilizer
  Cloning https://github.com/continuumio/tranquilizer.git (to revision 0.5.0) to /private/var/folders/lk/s__7f9fx15x_zrw6q5xkmm500000gp/T/pip-install-5ncd7pbt/tranquilizer_d037aa7b85d048c1acd4e2f0044c4cea
  Using Conda environment /Users/adefusco/Desktop/testproj/envs/default.
  Added packages to project file: git+https://github.com/continuumio/tranquilizer.git@0.5.0#egg=tranquilizer.

Alternatively for github you can use the URL of the repository archive. For example, to install
from the master branch of tranquilizer::

  $ anaconda-project add-packages --pip https://github.com/continuumio/tranquilizer/archive/master.zip#egg=tranquilizer
  Collecting tranquilizer
  Downloading https://github.com/continuumio/tranquilizer/archive/master.zip
  Using Conda environment /Users/adefusco/Desktop/testproj/envs/default.
  Added packages to project file: https://github.com/continuumio/tranquilizer/archive/master.zip#egg=tranquilizer.
